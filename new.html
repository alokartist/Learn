    <h1>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <b>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</b> is a
      professional association for electronic engineering and electrical
      engineering (and associated disciplines) with its corporate office in New
      York City and its operations center in Piscataway, New Jersey. The mission
      of the <b>IEEE</b> is advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.The
      <b>IEEE</b> was formed from the amalgamation of the American Institute of
      Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1963. Due to
      its expansion of scope into so many related fields, it is simply referred
      to by the letters I-E-E-E (pronounced I-triple-E), except on legal
      business documents. As of 2018, it is the world's largest association of
      technical professionals with more than 423,000 members in over 160
      countries around the world. Its objectives are the educational and
      technical advancement of electrical and electronic engineering,
      telecommunications, computer engineering and similar disciplines.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>IEEE</b> traces its founding to 1884 and the American Institute of
      Electrical Engineers. In 1912, the rival Institute of Radio Engineers was
      formed. Although the <b>AIEE</b> was initially larger, the IRE attracted
      more students and was larger by the mid-1950s.The <b>AIEE</b> and IRE
      merged in 1963. The <b>IEEE</b> headquarters is in New York City at 3 Park
      Ave, but most business is done at the <b>IEEE</b> Operations Center in
      Piscataway, NJ, first occupied in 1975.
    </p>
    <h3>Growth</h3>
    <p>
      <b>The American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE)</b> and the
      <b>Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE)</b> merged to create the
      <b>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</b> on January
      1, 1963. At that time, the combined group had 150,000 members, 93% in the
      United States. By 1984 there were 250,000 members, 20% of whom were
      outside the U.S.[citation needed] The Australian Section of the
      <b>IEEE</b> existed between 1972 and 1985. After this date, it split into
      state- and territory-based sections. As of 2021, <b>IEEE</b> has over
      400,000 members in 160 countries, with the U.S. based membership no longer
      constituting a majority.

    <h2>Publications</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <b>IEEE</b> claims to produce over 30% of the world's literature in the
      electrical and electronics engineering and computer science fields,
      publishing approximately 200 peer-reviewed journals and magazines.
      <b>IEEE</b> publishes more than 1,200 conference proceedings every year.
      The published content in these journals as well as the content from
      several hundred annual conferences sponsored by the <b>IEEE</b> are
      available in the <b>IEEE</b> Electronic Library (IEL)available through
      <b>IEEE</b> Xplore platform, for subscription-based access and individual
      publication purchases. In addition to journals and conference proceedings,
      the <b>IEEE</b> also publishes tutorials and standards that are produced
      by its standardization committees. The organization also has its own
      <b>IEEE</b> format paper.
